\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
Coronaviruses (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that may cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. The novel COVID-19 outbreak was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak later spread to every province of mainland China and 188 other countries, with more than 118 million confirmed cases and more than 2.63 million deaths as of March 8, 2021 [REF]. The first COVID-19 case was reported in South Africa
on 5 March 2020 [REF]. As of March 8, 2021, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa represents around 3\% of the infection worldwide. South Africa had the highest burden of COVID-19 cases in the African region, with 1.5 million reported cases and 50,678 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths[REF].

During this period, countries, including South Africa, have adopted various measures to control the virus's spread, including border closure, mandatory use of fabric masks, contact tracing, and stay-at-home measures. Due to the uncertainties about the disease and the need to make informed policy decisions, modelling has taken centre stage in supporting critical policy discussions surrounding COVID-19. COVID-19 modelling studies generally follow one of two general approaches—the phenomenological and mechanistic models. Phenomenological models are statistical models that use generic strategies such as regression to provide quantitative projections that policymakers may need to allocate resources or plan interventions in the short term. On the other hand, mechanistic models use parameters and functional forms to represent our knowledge and assumptions on transmission, disease, and immunity to produce a long-term forecast. 

Several authors implemented phenomenological and mechanistic models to describe the early course of COVID-19 in South Africa and produce short-term and long-term forecasts using the data from the early phase of the epidemic{[}1{]}. In this paper we present (1) South Africa's one year COVID trajectory and (2) fit a series of temporal models to produce short term predictions of the number of reported cases expected for a period of 10 days ahead. 
%Building on popular temporal models, this part of the thesis aims to develop statistical approaches to characterize the course of the COVID-19 outbreak and produce short term forecasts using daily reports of tests and confirmed COVID-19 cases.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

We downloaded data from Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository
for South Africa maintained by Data Science for Social Impact research
group at the University of Pretoria (https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za). The data repository
captures the daily number of new cases, number of tests, number of
deaths and recoveries. Our primary outcome of interest was the daily
number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and the unit of time used in
modelling was a day. We used the daily case reports from March 12, 2020,
until February 27, 2021, in our analysis.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

We considered four widely used temporal models to study the evolution of the number of daily COVID-19 cases. We let \(Y(t)\) denote the daily
number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases at time \(t\) and \(\mu(t)\)
represent the expected number of cases at time \(t\). We considered a
Negative binomial distribution for \(Y(t)\) to account for possible
overdispersion. That is, \(Y(t) \sim NB(\mu(t), \delta)\), where
\(\delta\) is the overdispersion parameter. We considered four temporal
models to capture the trend over time: a random walk of order one (\(RW(2)\)), a random walk of order (\(RW(2)\)), an autoregressive model of order one (\(AR(1)\)), and an autoregressive model of order two (\(AR(2)\))
{[}2{]} which are presented in Table \ref{tab:Models}. 

%We also considered a \(RW(1)\) model, but the model overfits thedata (See the supplementary appendix). Similarly, we considered an \(AR\)model order \(p=2\) but the result is similar to \(AR1\) model and weprefer the simpler \(AR1\) model.The \(AR(1)\) model {[}1{]} is given by,
%\[
%\begin{aligned}
% Y(t) &\sim NB(\mu(t), \delta) \ \ t=1, \dots, n,\\
% log(\mu(t)) &= \alpha+u_t, \\
% u_1 &\sim N(0, \tau_u(1-\rho^2)^{-1}),  \\
%  u_t &=\rho u_{t-1} +\epsilon_t, \ \ t=2, \dots, n,  \\
%  \epsilon_t & \sim N(0, \tau_{\epsilon}),
%\end{aligned}
%\] where, \(\alpha\) is an intercept, \(\rho\) a temporal correlation
%term (with \(|\rho|<1\)) and \(\epsilon_t\) is a Gaussian error term
%with zero mean and precision \(\tau_{\epsilon}\).

%Similarly, the \(RW(2)\) model {[}1{]} is given by, \[
%\begin{aligned}
% Y(t) &\sim NB(\mu(t), \delta) \ \ t=1, \dots, n,\\
% log(\mu(t)) &= \alpha+u_t, \\
% u_t-2u_{t+1}+u_{t+2} &\sim N(0, \tau_u), \ \ t=2, \dots, n,
%\end{aligned}
%\] where \(\alpha\) is the intercept term as before and \(\tau_u\) is
%the precision parameter.

\end{table}

Each models were fitted within the Bayesian framework using
\emph{inla} {[}3{]}. To complete the specification of each models, we
assume the following priors. For both the \(RW(1)\) and \(RW(2)\), we represent the precision parameter of
\(\tau_u\) as \(\theta=log(\tau_u)\) and assume a
\(\Gamma (10,100)\) prior for \(\theta\).  For the \(AR(1)\) model, we denote
\(\theta_1=log(\tau_u(1-\rho^2))\) where \(\Gamma(10,100)\) prior is
specified for \(\theta_1\), and we denote
\(\theta_2=log\frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}\) and assume a \(N(0, 0.15)\) prior
for \(\theta\). 

The short-term prediction performance of all these models were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and chi-squared value. Additionally, the model fits were evaluated by using Deviance information criteria (DIC) {[}5{]} and Watanabe–Akaike information criterion (WAIC){[}5{]}. The R-codes that we used for our analyses are available at
https://github.com/belayb/COVIDincidenceSA.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

The daily number of reported COVID-19 cases from 12
March 2020 to 27 February 2021 is presented in Figure \ref{fig:daily-cases}. Similar to elsewhere in the world, South
Africa pass through a two-wave pandemic. The pandemic first peak was
on 07 July 2020, where up to 13944 new COVID-19 cases reported, followed
by a second peak in January 2021, where more than 21,000 daily cases
reported. Figure \ref{fig:cummulative} presents the cumulative number of reported
COVID-19 cases and tests performed. To date, 8,838,937 tests have been
conducted, and a total of 1,500,677 cases reported.

\subsection{Short-term prediction of the total number of reported
COVID-19
cases}\label{short-term-prediction-of-the-total-number-of-reported-covid-19-cases}}

We fit the four models described in the previous section to the daily
reported new COVID-19 cases. The models were fitted to the data from 12/03/2020-07/02/2021 (estimation period). The parameter estimates for each of the fitted models
are presented in Supplementary Table \ref{tab:parest}. Our main interest to produce a short-term forecast for the number of reported cases.  Figure \ref{fig:ar1fitted} - \ref{fig:rw2fitted} in the supplementary appendix presents the fitted model to the observed data (panel A) and the first-order derivative of the fitted curve for each model. All models considered appear to fit the observed data (within the estimation period) well. Nonetheless, the \(AR(1)\), \(AR(2)\), and \(RW(1)\) tend to overfit the data. 

Figure \ref{fig:10daypred} and Table \ref{tab:10daypred} presents 10-days ahead forecasting of the cumulative COVID-19 cases for each model. The \(AR(1)\), \(AR(2)\), and \(RW(1)\) models performed well for the first three forecasting days and overestimated the cumulative cases from day three onward. The overestimation worsens for these models as we move further from the estimation period. On the other hand, the \(RW(2)\) performed well, showing a consistent prediction performance throughout the forecasting period.  The prediction error (\(observed - predicted\)) for \(RW(2)\) stays between 1932 and 3222 cases, whereas the prediction error linearly increase for the other models. 

Table \ref{tab:Accuracy} presents the accuracy metrics for each model. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and Chi-square statistic favours \(RW(2)\) as the best model predictive model. On the other hand, DIC and WAIC favours \(RW(1)\) model. This is expected given that the DIC and WAIC evaluate model performance within estimation period.

\section{Discussion}\label{Discussion}}

Reliable and accurate short-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases are critical to understand the progress of the pandemic in a country and to evaluate the impact of intervention measures in controlling the pandemic. This study modelled COVID-19 cases in South Africa at the national level using publicly available data from 12 March 2020 to 17 February 2021. We have evaluated four widely used temporal models for forecasting confirmed cases of COVID-19 for South Africa. Our study showed that these established temporal models could provide robust and accurate short-term forecasts for a period ten days ahead. The random-walk model of order two was superior to the random-walk of order one and autoregressive models in forecasting performance.  

This study's strength is that the analysis was based on readily accessible, publicly available data that is updated in real-time. The statistical methods applied are relatively simple, implemented using off-the-shelf open-source software, and are not dependent on any assumptions regarding COVID-19 transmission dynamics. 

In summary, we have shown the usefulness of established temporal models to provide short term forecasts of the cumulative COVID-19 cases. Such models could help in decision-making when knowledge regarding factors affecting transmission-dynamics of the disease is limited.
